##Why are we here?

ORCID provides an identifier for researchers _AND_ tools (like APIs) to help make connections between researchers, their contributions, and affiliations. **Why?** To help people find information, and to simplify reporting and analysis.

ORCID wants to help make it possible to do things like:

* Find all of a researcher’s work with a single query
* Auto-populate manuscript submission and grant application forms
* Get (nearly) real-time data about researchers’ publications and grants
* Find the current affiliation(s) of any researcher

ORCID can't do this on its own - integrations with other systems (like manuscript submission/production, funding application, repository, research information, and directory systems) are essential. 

This workshop provides an introduction to integrating ORCID into your systems, so that, together, we can help everyone involved in research spend more time *making* contributions and less time *managing* them!

##Collect & Connect
A top-notch ORCID integration includes the following capabilities:

<img src="images/Collect_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Collect icon"/> **Collect** authenticated ORCID iDs

<img src="images/Connect_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Connect icon"/> **Connect** Get data from ORCID/add data to ORCID

<img src="images/Synchronize_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Synchronize icon"/> **Synchronize** Get data from ORCID/add data to ORCID on an ongoing basis 

<img src="images/Display_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Display icon"/> **Display** iDs you’ve collected in your own system

##About the ORCID APIs
ORCID's web interface gives researchers a way to interact with their record, but the real power of ORCID lies in the underlying data, which can be accessed by people and systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

* **Public API:** Free to anyone with an ORCID iD
* **Member API:** Available to ORCID member organizations (Sandbox Member API freely available for testing)

| Features       | Public API | Member API |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
|**COLLECT**<br>Get authenticated ORCID iDs| <img src="images/Collect_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Collect icon"/> | <img src="images/Collect_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Collect icon"/> |
|**CONNECT**<br>Get data from ORCID/add data to ORCID| *Get public data only<br>(can't add data)* | <img src="images/Connect_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Connect icon"/> |
|**SYNCHRONIZE**<br>Get data from ORCID/add data to ORCID on an ongoing basis| *Get public data only<br>(can't add data)* | <img src="images/Synchronize_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Synchronize icon"/> |
|**DISPLAY**<br>Show iDs you’ve collected in your own system| <img src="images/Display_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Display icon"/> | <img src="images/Display_4PP.png" class="icon" width="28" alt="ORCID Display icon"/> |

All of the ORCID APIs are  based on the same set of technologies:

* **REST:** ORCID APIs are &ldquo;RESTful&rdquo;, which  means that they use HTTP to transfer information.
* **OAuth:** ORCID  APIs use the [OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to grant client  applications access to users&rsquo; ORCID records.
* **XML/JSON:** ORCID APIs support data exchange in either XML or JSON format.
