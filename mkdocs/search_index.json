WELCOME\n\n\n0.1 About the ORCID APIs\n\n\nORCID's web interface gives researchers a way to interact with their record, but the real power of ORCID lies in the underlying data, which can be accessed by people and systems via Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI\nVersion\n\n\nAccess\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic\nAPI\n\n\nFreely available to anyone\n\n\nAuthenticate:\n Obtain a user\ns authenticated ORCID iD\n \nRead (Public):\n Search/retrieve public data\n \nCreate:\n Create new ORCID records on demand\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember\nAPI\n\n\nAvailable to organizations that support ORCID with an annual membership subscription\n(Sandbox Member API freely available to all for testing)\n\n\nAll Public API features, plus:\n \nRead (Limited):\n Search/retrieve public data\n \nUpdate:\n Post new items to a record (affiliations, works, etc.) or edit items that you added previously\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll of the ORCID APIs are  based on the same set of technologies:\n\n\n\n\nREST:\n ORCID APIs are \nRESTful\n, which  means that they use HTTP (hyper-text transfer) calls to transfer information.\n\n\nOAuth:\n ORCID  APIs use the OAuth 2.0 authentication protocol in order to grant client  applications access to users\n ORCID records.\n\n\nXML/JSON:\n ORCID APIs support data exchange in either XML or JSON format.\n\n\n\n\n0.2 Pre-requisites\n\n\nTo complete this tutorial, you'll need the following tools:\n\n\n\n\nWeb browser:\n Firefox (33+), Chrome (38+), Internet Explorer (10+), Safari (6+)\n\n\nInternet connection\n\n\nPlain text editor:\n TextEdit (Mac), Notepad++ (Win), or your preferred plain text editor\n\n\nSoftware capable of making HTTP requests:\n\n\ncURL: Free, command-line application available for Mac  or Windows at \nhttp://curl.haxx.se/download.html\n (pre-installed on most Mac OS versions; accessible within Terminal application)\n\n\nOnline tools, like \nGoogle OAuth Playground\n or \nhurl.it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples in this doc use \nGoogle OAuth Playground\n\n\n1. THE SANDBOX\n\n\nFor this workshop, we'll use ORCID's test environment, the \nORCID Sandbox\n. The Sandbox works just like the production ORCID Registry, with a few exceptions:\n\n\n\n\nSandbox only sends emails to \nmailinator.com\n addresses \n\n\nImport wizard tools don't work in the Sandbox\n\n\nMenu links to informational content (For Researchers, For Organizations, About, Help, etc) don't work in the Sandbox\n\n\nSandbox doesn't contain production data\n\n\n\n\n1.1 Create a Sandbox ORCID record\n\n\nTo get started, you'll need to register an ORCID iD in the Sandbox.\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit \nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/register\n\n\nComplete the form with a name, email, and password.\n\n\nIMPORTANT!\n Don\nt use a real email address! Instead, make up an address  ending in @mailinator.com (ex: sgarcia@mailinator.com).\n\n\n\n\nClick the \nI consent\u2026\n checkbox and click \nRegister\n.\n\n\nRemember the email and password - you'll need these throughout the rest of the tutorial!\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Verify your email address\n\n\nBefore you can edit information on your ORCID record, you'll need to verify your email address.\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit \nhttps://www.mailinator.com\n\n\nEnter the @mailinator.com address you used to register your Sandbox account and click \nGo\n.\n\n\n\n\nOpen the message with the subject \n[ORCID] Reminder to verify your email address\n and click the \nVerify your email address\n button.\n\n\n\n\nLog into ORCID, if prompted, to finish verifying your email. Since you've just registered, you are likely already logged in and will not be prompted to log in again.\n\n\nAfter verifying your email, you'll be redirected to your Sandbox record\n\n\nMake note of the 16-digit iD for your Sandbox record - you'll need this throughout the rest of the tutorial!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Add info to your Sandbox record\n\n\n\n\nAdd a country:\n Click the pencil icon beside Country, choose a country and click \nSave changes\n.\n\n\n\n\nAdd employment:\n In the \nEmployment\n section, click \nAdd employment\n \n \nAdd manually\n, fill out the form and click \nAdd to list\n.\n\n\n\n\nTake a look at your employment entry and notice the following fields, which are included with each item on an ORCID record: \n\n\nSource:\n Person or organization that added the item\n\n\nCreated:\n Date the item was added\n\n\nPrivacy:\n \nVisibility setting\n for the item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. READ PUBLIC INFO\n\n\nIn this section, we'll use the Public API to take a look at the underlying data for our Sandbox record. \n\n\n2.1 Read a record summary\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit \nhttps://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\nOn the left side of the screen, click \nStep 3 Configure request to API\n\n\nIn the \nRequest URI\n field enter:\n\n\nhttps://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/v2.0/[ORCID ID]/record\n\n\nReplace [ORCID ID] with the iD for your Sandbox record, format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSend the request\n\n\nA summary version of your record in XML format will appear in the \nRequest/Response\n section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Read activity details\n\n\nTo get more information about a specific item on an ORCID record, you can retrieve that individual item using its put-code.\n\n\n\n\nIn the record summary XML, find the \nactivities-summary\n section, then find the \nput-code\n for the employment item that you added in the previous section.\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nRequest URI\n field enter:\n\n\nhttps://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/v2.0/[ORCID ID]/employment/[PUT CODE]\n\n\nReplace [ORCID ID] with the iD for your Sandbox record, format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX and [PUT CODE] with the put-code for your employment item\n\n\n\n\nClick \nSend the request\n\n\nFulls details of your employment entry will appear in the \nRequest/Response\n section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. SEARCH PUBLIC INFO\n\n\nIn addition to reading information on a specific ORCID record, you can use the API to search for ORCID records that contain specific information.\n\n\nIn this section, we'll try searches using just a few of the available fields. For a full list of fields that you can search, see our \nBasic tutorial: Searching Data using the ORCID API\n\n\n3.1 Search for records with an institutional affiliation\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit \nhttps://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\nOn the left side of the screen, click \nStep 3 Configure request to API\n\n\nIn the \nRequest URI\n field enter:\n\n\nhttps://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/v2.0/search/?q=affiliation-org-name:%22Boston%20University%22\n\n*Optional: \n\n\n\n\nClick \nSend the request\n\n\nThe total number of matching ORCID iDs and a list of those iDs will appear \nRequest/Response\n section\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Paging through search results\n\n\nIf your search matches more than 100 ORCID iDs, only the first 100 iDs will be returned in the list of results. To get the next set of results, you'll need to make another API request.\n\n\n\n\nOn the left side of the screen, click \nStep 3 Configure request to API\n\n\nIn the \nRequest URI\n field enter:\n\n\nhttps://pub.sandbox.orcid.org/v2.0/search/?q=affiliation-org-name:%22Boston%20University%22\nstart=101\nrows=200\n\n\nClick \nSend the request\n\n\nThe total number of matching ORCID iDs and a list of iDs 101-301 will appear in the \nRequest/Response\n section\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo get the entire set of results, repeat the query in step 2, changing \nstart=\n until you've reached collected all of your results.\n\n\n4. GET AUTHENTICATED iDs \n PERMISSION\n\n\nIn our first few API requests, we already knew which ORCID iD to use (our own!) and we read/serached public information, which didn't require any permission from the user. In practice, you'll need to gather up iDs for researchers whose ORCID records you want to read, update, or associate with records in your own system AND get permission to take certain actions, like adding information to their ORCID records.\n\n\nAuthenticated iDs\n\n\nORCID is all about identifying who's who, so it's important that you get the correct iD for each researcher. The best way to do this is to collect \nAuthenticated ORCID iDs\n, which means that each researcher signs into their ORCID account and authorizes your system to obtain their iD. \nLearn more about Authenticated iDs\n\n\nRecord access permission\n\n\nControl over access to data in your ORCID record is one of \nORCID's core princples\n. While you can read public ORCID data without the record owner's involvement, some API actions require permission:\n\n\n\n\nGet an Authenticated ORCID iD\n\n\nRead non-public data (items with privacy set to 'Trusted parties')\n\n\nAdd/update record data\n\n\n\n\n4.1 The old-fashioned way\n\n\nOAuth 2.0\n \n\n\nGetting an Authenticated iD and record access permission from a user involves following \nOAuth 2.0\n, an industry-standard protocol for authorization. OAuth allows a user to give a website or application access to account information stored on another site, without giving that site their password. \n\n\nIf you've ever signed into a site using Google or Facebook instead of your credentials for that particular site, you've already used OAuth!\n\n\nThe OAuth process includes 3 steps:\n\n\n\n\nCreate an authorization URL\n\n\nGet an authorization code\n\n\nExchange the authorization code for an access token\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Get API credentials\n\n\n4.1.2 Create an authorization URL\n\n\nTo kick off the OAuth process, we'll need to create an special authorization URL that sends users to an ORCID sign-in screen. This URL consists of \nAuthorization endpoint\n, plus \nParameters\n that identify your organization and the permissions you want to request.\n\n\nAuthorization endpoint (Sandbox)\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize\n\n\nParameters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\n\n\nDescription\n\n\nExample\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_id\n\n\nYour Member or Public API client ID (issued by ORCID)\nTo request API credentials, see \nRequest API credentials\n\n\nAPP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresponse_type\n\n\n\n\ncode\n\n\n\n\n\n\nscope\n\n\nAPI action(s) you want to request permission for, from the list of \nORCID Scopes\n.\n\n\n/authorize\n \n \n/activities/update\n\n\n\n\n\n\nredirect_uri\n\n\nPage on your site that users will see after they complete the authorization process (must be on the list of allowed redirect URIs you specified when requesting your API credentials)\n\n\nhttps://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo request permission to add/update activities (affiliations, funding, works, peer review items) using a demo client ID created for this workshop, our authorization URL will be:\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\nresponse_type=code\nscope=/activities/update\nredirect_uri=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Get an authorization Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a new window or tab, visit\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize?client_id=APP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\nresponse_type=code\nscope=/activities/update\nredirect_uri=https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn ORCID sign-in screen listing the requested permissions will appear; sign into your Sandbox account and click \nAuthorize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter granting permission, you'll be redirected to the Google OAuth Playground. A 6-character code will appear at the end of the redirect URI in the browser address bar (and under the \nStep 2\n section at left)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Exchange authorization code for access token \n authenticated iD\n\n\nOnce you have an  Authorization Code, you can exchange it for an Access Token and the Authenticated iD of the user who signed in, which you'll need in order to take the API action(s) you requested permission for. \n\n\nIn a real-world situation, this exchange would be done by your system, using a programming language such as  PHP, Java, or Ruby on Rails. For this workshop, we'll use Google OAuth Playground to simulate a web application.\n\n\n\n\nClick the gear icon in the upper right corner to open the \nOAuth 2.0 Configuration\n\n\n\n\nEnter the following settings and click \nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\n\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth flow\n\n\nServer-side\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth endpoints\n\n\nCustom\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthorization endpoint\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/authorize\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToken endpoint\n\n\nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/oauth/token\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccess token location\n\n\nAuthorization header w/Bearer prefix\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth Client ID\n\n\nAPP-XA6KUTFCVQL0622C\n(Demo client ID created for this workshop)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOAuth Client Secret\n\n\n7c8d6b1b-401b-4f5d-9b8b-b8108c6e197c\n(Demo client secret created for this workshop - do not share API client secrets!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nStep 2 Exchange authorization code for tokens\n section at left, click \nExchange authorization code for tokens\n\n\n\n\nYour Access Token and Authenticated iD will appear \nRequest/Response\n section at right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Institutional sign-in\n\n\nORCID recently added the option to sign in using institutional credentials. Institutional sign-in is available to researchers affiliated with members of supported identity federations, currently \nSURFconext\n and \neduGAIN\n.\n\n\nORCID membership is not required in order for instituional sign-in to work for your researchers, however, ORCID members who are \nSURFconext\n or \neduGAIN\n federation members can automatically request ORCID iDs and ORCID record access permission from users who sign into ORCID with their institutional credentials using the new Institutional Collect \n Connect feature.\n\n\nIn this section, we'll take a look at this feature.\n\n\n4.2.1 Get API credentials\n\n\n4.2.2 (User) Connect your institutional account\n\n\nNot a member of a supported federation?\n Test out ORCID institutional sign-in with a \nUnited ID\n account. United ID is a free and independent online identity service \n(Note: United ID requires use of a 2-Factor Authentication method, like \nGoogle Authenticator\n)\n.\n\n\n\n\nSign out of your Sandbox record - click the \nSign out\n button in the upper right corner or visit \nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/signout\n\n\nVisit \nhttps://sandbox.orcid.org/signin\n and click \nSign in using your Institutional Account\n\n\nEnter your organization's name in the box, or choose to pick it from the list. \n  \n\n\nSign into your institution account\n\n  \n\n\nFinish linking your accounts by signing into ORCID with your ORCID username and password. Enter the email address / ORCID iD and password for your Sandbox account and click \nSign into ORCID\n. \nYou will only need to complete this step once - in the future you can log directly into ORCID with your institutional account.\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Exchange authorization code for access token \n authenticated iD\n\n\n4.3 Share my iD\n\n\n6. CONNECT: ADD \n UPDATE INFO\n\n\nNow that we've got an Access Token, we can use it like a password to take the API actions we requested permission for (in this case, to update Activities). In this section, we'll add an education affiliation to our Sandbox record.\n\n\n6.1 Add an affiliation\n\n\n\n\nBeneath \nStep 3: Configure request to API\n, set \nHTTP Method\n to \nPOST\n.\n\n\n\n\nClick \nAdd headers\n, enter the values below, then click \nAdd\n and \nClose\n\n\nHeader name:\n \naccept\n\n\nHeader value:\n \napplication/vnd.orcid+xml\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the \nRequest URI\n field enter:\n\n\nhttps://api.sandbox.orcid.org/v2.0/[ORCID ID]/education\n\n\nReplace [ORCID ID] with the iD for your Sandbox record, format XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX\n\n\n\n\nClick \nContent-type\n \n \nCustom\n and enter \napplication/vnd.orcid+xml\n\n\n\n\nClick \nAdd\n, then click \nClose\n.\n\n\nClick \nEnter request body\n.\n\n\nCopy the education affiliation XML at the end of this section and paste it into the \nRequest Body\n text box\n\n\n\n\nOPTIONAL:\n In the \nRequest Body\n text box, edit the XML to reflect your institution.\n\n\nFor \ndisambiguated-organization-identifier\n, use the \nRinggold Identify database\n to find the Ringgold ID for your institution (you'll need to \nregister a free Ringgold account\n in order to search the database).\n\n\nClick \nClose\n.\n\n\nClick \nSend the  request\n.\n\n\nThe  results will appear in the \nRequest/Response\n section at right.
